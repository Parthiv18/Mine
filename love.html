      months. Spending time with you, like you being here for me is the best
      feeling ever and something super speical. Whatever I do for you feels so
      less and I just want to do everything. I rememeber when we first started

      will be by your side no matter what happens. But stop stressing too much
      and whatever you do, do it slowly please. Your eyes are like a maze, I'd
      love to get lost in them. Your nose is perfect, skin is bright, hair is
      flawless, and everything about you is just so beautiful. If you are the
      Sun, then I'd be the Earth constantly circling around you. I love you!!!!
